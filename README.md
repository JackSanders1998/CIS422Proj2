# Fetch: The Tinder for Doggy Playdates


The purpose of this app is to act as the Tinder for doggy playdates. Owners will download Fetch, make a profile, and from there, go through various doggy profiles to find the perfect match for their own beloved pup to play with, whenever and wherever.


## Requirements


* Xcode 12.4

* iOS 14.4+

* CocoaPods

## Installation


#### Xcode 12.4 (mac)


This environment must be installed in order to run Fetch. The download can be found at [Xcode 12](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)


#### iOS 14.4+


This application has not yet been deployed, but devices must be on version 14.4+ at the minimum in order to run this app.


#### CocoaPods


The Fetch project relies on dependencies through a Podfile. Therefore, CocoaPods must be installed on your local machine, which can be found at [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). 


Pull the repo:
```
"git pull "https://github.com/JackSanders1998/CIS422Proj2/tree/main/Fetch"
```

After the Fetch project is pulled, and CocoaPods is installed, open `terminal` and navigate to where the `Fetch` folder is located. Go into the Fetch folder and run:
```
pod repo update
```

Within the same directory run:
```
open Fetch.xcworkspace
```

This should open the workspace file in Xcode.
