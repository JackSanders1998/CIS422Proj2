# Fetch: The Tinder for Doggy Playdates

Fetch is an iOS application built for dog owners to match with other owners to set up playdates with their dogs. Owners can describe their petâ€™s attributes like name, breed, birthday, sex, whether they are spayed or neutered, and size. Owners swipe through a deck to confirm or reject a dog to receive matches. After matching with another dog, the owner can contact their match to set up a playdate.
