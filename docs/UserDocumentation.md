## Setup:

To get started, follow these [installation instructions](https://github.com/JackSanders1998/CIS422Proj2/blob/main/README.md).    

## Account Creation:

Once you download and open the Fetch app, you will be directed a Welcome page to create an account. Here you can enter your email address and a valid password longer than six characters. If the password is shorter than six characters, you will see an error message.

## Logging In:

After you create an account, you will be asked to login using those same credentials. If you do not enter the correct email or password, then you will receive an error message. Once you enter the correct information, you will be directed to a profile page to enter your dog's information.

## Profile Page:

Now you will see a profile page where you can enter your name, your dog's name, breed, and age. These attributes will be viewed by other users swiping through the deck, and be the basis for why users swipe "♡" or "X".

## Swiping through the Deck:

This is where you are able to match with other dog owners on the app. You can swipe "♡" or "X" to each dog that you view. If you match with the dog, they will be added to your match list.

## Viewing Matches:

Now you can view the dog owners that would like to have playdates with your dog. You can contact your matches using their email address listed with their account.
